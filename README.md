# Sentiment Analysis of the 2022/2023 Public Service Employee Survey

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes responses from the 2022 and 2023 Public Service Employee Survey (PSES) conducted across Canadian federal departments. Our goal was to uncover workplace sentiment patterns using a rule-based sentiment analysis approach, and visualize them through a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard.

Developed in collaboration with **Health Canada** as part of a real-world capstone project through **Algonquin College**, this project emphasizes the power of data storytelling in shaping inclusive, healthy, and productive public service environments.
